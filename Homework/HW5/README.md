1.	Problem-1.1: The replacement rate is 2.1 children per woman. According to one report: “If the replacement rate in a country is significantly below 2.1, the population will shrink over time. If it’s much higher than 2.1, the country will have much younger population down the road, which can cause problems. Younger populations, for example, show greater rates of violence and crime.” You are asked to highlight the data points of each country that are outside the range. For this exercise, let’s set the upper limit to 3.0 children per woman (replacement rate + 0.9) and the lower limit as the 1.2 children per woman (replacement rate – 0.9).  

Develop a visualization to allow the user to select a country (one country at a time) of his/her choice. The visualization should show the time-series of the country’s fertility rate and highlight the data points that are outside the limits that we defined.
